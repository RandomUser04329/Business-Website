# Business-Website
A Beginner Project using HTML and CSS code to practice designing a basic website for a business (example).

This project shows off my capabilities with somewhat knowledge of CSS and HTML. I will construct a website for a random business (example for when i make a site for an actual business). although some of the code may not look the best, it is still a learning ground for me and eventually will look back at this as an accomplishment.

Feel free to look and comments for suggestions or tips to where i could fix on!
